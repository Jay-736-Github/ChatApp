Chat Application

I built a full-stack chat application to get hands-on experience with real-time communication using WebSockets. This project helped me understand how to develop both the frontend and backend of a web app while focusing on real-time data transfer.

Key Features:

	•	Real-Time Messaging: Used WebSockets to enable instant communication between users with minimal delay.
	•	Full-Stack Development: Worked on both the frontend and backend, ensuring the app was well-structured and scalable.
	•	Responsive Design: Made sure the interface works smoothly on different screen sizes.
	•	Code Quality: Followed clean coding practices and proper documentation to keep the code maintainable.

I learned a lot from online resources and tutorials, which helped me understand the core concepts of real-time communication and full-stack development. This project not only improved my coding skills but also gave me a solid understanding of how real-time apps function.
